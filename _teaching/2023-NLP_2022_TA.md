Natural Language teaching assistantship working with Janet Pierrehumbert at the University of Oxford&apos;s Oxford Internet Institute. This class covers supervised and unsupervised language models to use for social data science. We show students how to build models inluding Naive Bayes, LSTM ... and apply them to a wide array of tasks in social data science including hate speech detection, topic classifications.
