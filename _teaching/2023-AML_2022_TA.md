This class covers advanced topics in Machine Learning for Social Data Science. We extend the course provided in the first term&apos;s Introduction to Machine Learning class. This will extend the mathematical foundations towards domains where we are uncertain about the right answer or best approach.

This course emphasizes applications in a variety of domains and focuses foremost on strategies for high quality results from data.
The topics we cover include : Creation of training and test datasets with techniques such as weak supervision, Transfer learning and fine-tuning models, the best practices for annotation, Bayesian approaches to estimation, Optimisation of hyperparameters using Bayesian optimisation and Techniques for interpretability and explainability.
