This course is a four-week intensive primer to get people up to speed on programming in the python programming language for use with data science. To note, python is not the only programming language you will encounter in this course, let alone this degree programme, but it is a great place to start. In week 4 we will compare differences between Python and R (another very popular language in data science). The goal of this course is to get students acquainted with clean, reusable, documented code. Learning machine learning and big data tools will be secondary to this task and come in later modules.
