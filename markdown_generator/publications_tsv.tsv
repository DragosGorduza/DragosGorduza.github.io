Quantitative and Computational Analysis of Text-, Image- and Video-as-Data"	"In financial markets, common sources of risk are often rendered and measured in the form of correlation.
While there exists a substantial body of literature on the structural impact of correlation in financial mar-
kets, the fundamental intuition rests primarily on estimating the exposure to joint risk sources through the
correlation matrix. However, price correlations alone fail to capture the entirety of the common risk envi-
ronment within which firms operate. This paper argues that a more comprehensive understanding of joint
risk exposure can be achieved by incorporating a causality network extracted from narrative parsing of news
and financial filings in economic models."	Gorduza, Ash (2023), Shared Causes, Shared Risks? Evidence from Economic News	Common_causes

A data-driven guide to WSB	Journal of Portfolio Management	"A trite yet fundamental question in economics is: What causes large asset price fluctuations? A tenfold rise in the price of GameStop equity, between the 22nd and 28th of January 2021, demonstrated that herding behaviour among retail investors is an important contributing factor. This paper presents a data-driven guide to the forum that started the hype -- WallStreetBets (WSB). Our initial experiments decompose the forum using a large language topic model and network tools. The topic model describes the evolution of the forum over time and shows the persistence of certain topics (such as the market / S\&P500 discussion), and the sporadic interest in others, such as COVID or crude oil. Network analysis allows us to decompose the landscape of retail investors into clusters based on their posting and discussion habits; several large, correlated asset discussion clusters emerge, surrounded by smaller, niche ones. A second set of experiments assesses the impact that WSB discussions have had on the market. We show that forum activity has a Granger-causal relationship with the returns of several assets, some of which are now commonly classified as `meme stocks', while others have gone under the radar. The paper extracts a set of short-term trade signals from posts and long-term (monthly and weekly) trade signals from forum dynamics, and considers their predictive power at different time horizons. In addition to the analysis, the paper presents the dataset, as well as an interactive dashboard, in order to promote further research."

This signal builds on the key information-brokerage role financial sell-side analysts play in modern stock markets. The baskets of stocks covered by each analyst can be used to construct a network between firms whose edge weights represent the number of analysts jointly covering both firms. Although the link between financial analysts coverage and co-movement of firms√ï stock prices has been investigated in the literature, little effort has been made to systematically learn the most effective combination of signals from firms covered jointly by analysts in order to benefit from any spillover effect. To fill this gap, we build a trading strategy which leverages the analyst coverage network using a graph attention network. More specifically, our model learns to aggregate information from individual firm features and signals from neighbouring firms in a node-level forecasting task. We develop a portfolio based on those predictions which we demonstrate to exhibit an annualized returns of 29.44% and a Sharpe ratio of 4.06 substantially outperforming market baselines and existing graph machine learning based frameworks. We further investigate the performance and robustness of this strategy through extensive empirical analysis. Our paper represents one of the first attempts in using graph machine learning to extract actionable knowledge from the analyst coverage network for practical financial applications.

The emergence of transformer-based language models have opened the possibility of improving the financial supervision process, by assisting supervisors with labour-intensive and time-consuming tasks of information retrieval across the wide range of complex corpora like financial rules and regulations. This paper introduces Prudential Regulation Embedding Transformer (PRET), a novel domain-adapted transformer encoder model tailored for information retrieval on topics relating to financial regulations. To train this model, we address the scarcity of high-quality training financial regulations text datasets with a dedicated pipeline to web-scrape and pre-process the Basel Framework into machine-readable format, which is then coupled with corresponding large language model (LLM) generated text as synthetic training data pairs for each rule in the Basel Framework. We evaluate the performance of our model on this domain-specific information retrieval task against commonly used state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. We show how our proposed model outperforms existing benchmarks while being substantially cheaper to train than previous methods. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of better regulatory technology models across jurisdictions.
